    <h2>Jesse's Summary of Basic HTML</h2>
    <b>HTML Structure</b>
    <br>
    <p1>Every HTML document has to follow the same structure so that <b>STUPID</b> computers can understand them.<br>
    This skeleton structure is comprised of certain key elements. The beginning of an HTML document starts with <b>!DOCTYPE HTML</b>.<br>
    This is greyed out in text editors with syntax editing enabled as it is a void tag and just states the format of the document.<br>
    The next tag is the <b><em>HTML</em> tag</b> which comes straight after the doctype. The last line of any html document will have the closing tags <b> HTML</b>.<br>
    This is followed by the <b> <em> HEAD</em> tag</b> which contains information about CSS and javascript files as well as the <b> <em>TITLE</em> tag</b>.<br>
    Then comes the <b><em>BODY</em> tag</b> which is where all the contents of the web page is coded.<br>
    </p1><br>
    
    <div>
      <b>HTML Tags</b>
    </div>
    <p1>
      There are many different types of HTML tags and remembering all of them would be a big task. That's why we can look them up with <b>APIs</b> and websites such as <a href="www.w3schools.com"> W3Schools</a>.<br>
      We get <b>opening</b> tags and <b>closing</b> tags and both of them together form <b>elements</b>. Examples of these would be the <b> B-tag</b> or <em>Em-tag</em>.<br>
      Although there are exceptions such as <b>void</b> tags which do not need a closing tag. An example of a void tag would be the <b>Break-tag</b>.<br>
      
    </p1><br>
    
    <div>
      <b>Attributes</b>
    </div>
    
    <p1>
      There are certain elements that can be given <b>attributes</b>.<br>
      Attributes such as <em>href</em> and <em>src</em> can be given <b>values</b> such as a link to another page on the <a href="#">internet</a> or a link to an image <span> <img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5750/20452210534_af0ae1441b_o.png"> </span> to be displayed on your webpage.<br>
    </p1><br>
    
    <div>
      <b>Inline and Block Elements</b>
    </div>
    
    <p1>
      HTML Elements are split into 2 categories: either <strong>Inline</strong> or <strong>Block</strong> elements.<br>
      Inline Elements keep the text within the opening and closing tags in the <b>same line</b> as the previous element just as if you were typing on a type writer <img src="http://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/128/115/115779.png">. <br>
      Block Elements have an <em>invisible</em> <b>"block"</b> that surrounds the element. This block has width and height and forces the element to be displayed on a new line.
